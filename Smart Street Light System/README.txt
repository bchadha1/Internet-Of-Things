-------------------------------

To run the project, first, compile the Arduino code using Ardunio IDE. Then, if the code compiles successfully, upload the code to Arduino board using USB cable.

Explanation of the code- The 'Smart_Street_Light_System' code has two functions.
1. To check LDR sensor
2. To check IR sensor

when all the conditios are true and excuted, the LED light glows when an object is detected by the IR sensor in the absense of pre-defined light intensity, which is detected by the LDR sensor.

'Blink_Slider' code

This functionality is used to connect any smartphone to the arduino board to control the LED or the sensors and to monitor the readings or output.

To run this code-
1. Compile it in Arduino IDE and upload it to the Arduino board.
2. Setup the Blynk application on the smartphone and copy the Auth Token sent on your email id.
3. Copy the token code to the program and upload the program to Arduino board.
4. LED and sensors will be able to control from the smartphone using Blynk app
